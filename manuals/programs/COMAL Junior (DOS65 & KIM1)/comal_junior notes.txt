COMAL for DOS65

COMAL is an interpreted structured language. I have only as original the KIM User Club Elektor Junior version, and as with most of the 6502 SBC programs, not that difficult to adapt to a KIM-1, as told on the last pages of the manual (in/out/break character, load/save tape, memory layout). In theory perhaps, I failed up till now.
