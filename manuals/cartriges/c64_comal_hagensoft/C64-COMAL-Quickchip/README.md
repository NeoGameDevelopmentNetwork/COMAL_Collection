## C64 COMAL QuickChip extension

Information about COMAL itself can be found here:<br />

<br />

### QuickChip for COMAL80 is an extension for the existing COMAL80 module for the C64/C128

#### Info about the modul:

This modul contains a floppy speeder for COMAL<br />
loading from the attached floppy disc can be 3 to 5 times faster then normal

The source code was created on the basis of COMAL80 Quickchip extensions freely available on the Internet.<br />
The extensions created with this source code were compared by me with the existing data and correspond to this 1:1<br />
I have have only changed the fillbytes at the end of the program.

The source code is mostly undocumented, only in a few places I have added some documentation.

Information about the structure of a COMAL extension and its packages can be found e.g. here in this book.<br />
